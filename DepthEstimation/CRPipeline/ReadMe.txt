[A simple R & C implementation of the pipeline for depth estimation]

This is a simple proof-of-concept implementation of the pipeline for depth estimation using R and C.

1. Dependency:

Required Libs: SDL(http://www.libsdl.org/), SDL_image, SDL_mixer, SDL_ttf, libfreetype, libpng, mikmod, zlib.

Optional: R(http://www.r-project.org/).

2. How to Run:

In windows: Run the script "Run.R" in R. You can also click "run.bat", or using the cmd "myprogram.exe -input -output" to test the C program directly. 

For other systems such as Linux, you need to recompile the source code for your system.
   
3. Compile the Source:

See "compile.txt".
